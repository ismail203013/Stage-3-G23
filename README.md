This is the most recent collaborative work however due to our local servers not 
allowing us to share a database in Github it limited all of us to not being able to test anything, 
just adding code from previous testing. So, we decided that it would be best to finish off the code on one personâ€™s machine, 
outside of Github so that nothing interferes with the database such as Github tracking, 
then that person could send the zip without a database in it. 
Meaning we can add our own local database and table scripts.
